# Suppose we want to ensure that the car model should always be between 2000 and
# 2018. If a user tries to enter a value less than 2000 for the car model, the
# value is automatically set to 2000 and if the entered value is greater than
# 2018, it should be set to 2018. If the value is between 2000 and 2018, it
# should not be changed.Â
